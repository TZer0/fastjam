# fastjam
C++ scene-based physics + rendering engine. Compiles to JS and native.

## Build instructions
Coming soon.

## Planned features
- 2D rendering through SDL
- Scene-based game logic with a central controller for persistency
- Two kinds of scenes: physics/float-based (intended for platformers, fighters and more), grid-based (intended for puzzle games with step-movement or other games with grid-based movement). One game will be able to contain scenes of different types
- Event-driven logic (such as collisions) for physics-based scenes with object tagging (multiple tags per object!)
- Simple file-management/loading
- Menu-system
- Test-driven development - both in terms of testing your own game logic and the engine logic. This means that you can hack on and still be sure that the engine will behave.

## Features that are being considered
- 3D rendering + scenes
